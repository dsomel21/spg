# SPG App

## Getting Started
This is a project I have always had in the back of mind but never started.

I changed up the stack on this, but here is the technologies that I am considering to use on this: 

* **TypeScript**: Might sound clumsy, but I do not want to write a lot of tests... so I am willing to use TypeScript.  
* **GraphQL**: I like GraphQL
* **TypeORM**: Never used this but it sounds very promising and it is always up to date.
* **PostgreSQL**: For DB.
* **React**: [Cuz why not](https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/598144948559605760)
* Node/Express/Apollo: Setup backend. 

I will update the [TODO file](TODO.md) when I get a chance, but tbh, gonna setup authentication and authorization first... might take some time as I need to get familiar with TS first and TypeORM. 

## Project
This project is dedicated to the Great Poet, Kavi Santokh Singh and to _the selfless warriors who ate steel ensuring our unbridled access
to the knowledge of our Gurus and ancestors_ ( - Manglacharan 2017).

Kavi Ji has contributed his life to poetically documenting the life of the Sikh Guru's. This project strives to create a central database for Kavi Ji's *Gurprataap Sooraj Granth* (also known as *Sooraj Prakash Granth*)

Important Links: 
* [Rara Sahib - ik13.com](https://www.ik13.com/bhai-daya-singh-ji-online-library/) - Essentially the only copy/pastable PDF of *SPG*
* [Anvaad JS](https://github.com/KhalisFoundation/anvaad-js) - Very useful tool to for when dealing with transliteration/ASCII/unicode converting in the context of the Gurmukhi language.
