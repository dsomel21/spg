# SPG App

## Getting Started
This is a project I have always had in the back of mind but never started. 

I changed up the stack on this, but here is the technologies that I am considering to use on this: 

* **TypeScript**: Might sound clumsy, but I do not want to write a lot of tests... so I am willing to use TypeScript.  
* **GraphQL**: I like GraphQL
* **TypeORM**: Never used this but it sounds very promising and it is always up to date.
* **PostgreSQL**: For DB.
* **React**: [Cuz why not](https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/598144948559605760)
* Node/Express/Apollo: Setup backend. 

I will update the [TODO file](TODO.md) when I get a chance, but tbh, gonna setup authentication and authorization first... might take some time as I need to get familiar with TS first and TypeORM.
